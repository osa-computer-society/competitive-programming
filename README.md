## Language of choice: C++
- [C++ tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
- Most of our code is written using C++. To run a C++ file (.cpp) from the Mac/Linux terminal:
  1. `cd` to the directory containing the file you want to run.
  2. Type `g++ [filename]`. This should create a file named `a.out` in the same directory.
  3. To run the file, type `./a.out` in your terminal and press enter.
  4. The program should run.
- You can test this using the `hello_world.cpp` file.

### Conventions
- Use the standard namespace, i.e. put `using namespace std;` at the top of your C++ files.
- Use underscores to separate words in function and variable names, i.e. `book_genre`
