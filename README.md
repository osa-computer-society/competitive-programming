# competitive-programming
Where a couple of friends and I practice for computing competitions. Feel free to open up a pull request if you have solutions to contribute! Always remember to attempt the problem before you look at the solution. Don't copy-paste a solution: even typing it out is better! It'll help you build up the muscle memory.

# Resources

## Language of choice: C++
- [C++ tutorial](http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/)
- Most of our code is written using C++. To run a C++ file (.cpp) from the Mac/Linux terminal:
  1. `cd` to the directory containing the file you want to run.
  2. Type `g++ [filename]`. This should create a file named `a.out` in the same directory.
  3. To run the file, type `./a.out` in your terminal and press enter.
  4. The program should run.
- You can test this using the `hello_world.cpp` file.
- P.S. an interesting way to learn the language is translating the existing code! Try translating some of my Kattis solutions to C++.

### Conventions
- Use the standard namespace, i.e. put `using namespace std;` at the top of your C++ files.
- Use underscores to separate words in function, variable and file names, i.e. `book_genre` or `cpp_primer`.
- Our suffix for the files is `.cpp`, just to keep things consistent.
- I'm not too worried about style conventions, as long as it's readable (i.e. proper indentation).
