# International Olympiad of Informatics (IOI)

The IOI is an annual competition for high school students around the world. It's the biggest competition in terms of size and prestige and is the ultimate goal for aspiring competitive programmers.

Only four members are chosen to represent each country. In Canada, the route to the IOI is as follows:

1. Write the Canadian Computing Competition in February at the Senior level
2. Approximately the top 20 contestants are invited to the Canadian Computing Olympiad (CCO) at the University of Waterloo
3. The top 4 students are chosen to represent Canada at the IOI during the summer. See **[this page on the CEMC website](https://cemc.uwaterloo.ca/contests/computing/canada_ioi.html)** for information about Canada's prior participation.
